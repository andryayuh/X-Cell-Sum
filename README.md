# X-Cell Sum

Welcome to X-Cell Sum app!
Woo!

# Feature Spec
* Support positive and negative integers.
* Ignore blank cells
* Ignore non-numeric cells. A sum should still be calculated if some cells are text (like “apple”) and other cells are numbers, in the same column.
* Numbers can be anywhere in the column.
* Numbers do not have to start at the top of the column.
* Numbers do not have to be adjacent.
* You cannot type directly into the sum row. It is not a normal data row, in that sense.
